// variables is a place holder aka a box
// we declare new variables with var
// we reassign old variables with =
// variables can vary,be reused, and swap out what is inside
// variables have a label so we know whats inside
// the computer does not care what the name is as long as its there
// the var label can not be a keyword(ex: if and for) or non alphabetical characters other than _, start with a int or an uppercase, or have any spaces\
// naming convention: the first word starts with lowercase and every word after is an uppercase
// computers are dumb because whatever information u gave it takes at face value and is unable to change it unless told otherwise
// without data computers have no programs, or "intellect"
// the 3 data types are:
// strings: text surronded by either a pair of single quotes or a pair of double quotes(a single quote can have double quotes inside)
// numbers: whole numbers and decimal numbers
// boolean: true or false
//null means nothing
//undefined means not defined
